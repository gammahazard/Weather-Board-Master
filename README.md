# Weather Dashboard Master
Welcome to my first application involving a third-party API!

When loaded, this simple application will allow you to input a city name (any city in the world!) and it will tell you the current forecast, as well as the five-day forecast for that city!




Search history is saved through local storage and displayed upon visiting the page! (working on fix to display more than one value)



Parameters shown for current forecast: Temperature (°F), Humidity (%), Wind Speed (MPH) and UVI (color coded for easy interpertation)



Parameters shown for 5-day forecast: Day of week, Temperature (°F) and Humidity (%)



Along with the parameters, an icon is displayed that indicates the current conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy etc ....)

How it looks:
